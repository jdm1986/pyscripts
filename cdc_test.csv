As of February 22, 2018, the owner has issued request for proposals to the short listed design/build firms and expect to make an award April 19, 2018. It is anticipated construction will start in June 2018 and be completed in February 2019. *The closed solicitation has been included below for reference: Sealed Statement of Qualifications (SOQ) for Design and Build of Bulk Terminal, Contract 31701-C1, at the Port of Indiana-Jeffersonville, Clark County, Indiana The project consists of constructing a new barge transload facility at the Port of Indiana Jeffersonville in Clark County, Indiana. The scope of work for the Design-Builder includes design and build services for a covered rail and truck dump pit for bulk commodities including conveyors to a load-out facility on the Ohio River. The project scope also includes installation of a sheetpile mooring cell in the River and approximately 2,280 LF of railroad track. The Ports of Indiana (POI) will be the procuring public agency for the Project. The Request for Qualifications (RFQ) is the first step of a two-step process to select the Design-Builder. POI will evaluate the SOQs received in response to this RFQ and, on the basis of these evaluations, intends to Select potential Design Builders for delivering the Project (Qualified Design Builders) in accordance with the procedures and evaluation criteria described in the RFQ and in accordance with IC 5-30-5. The second step of the two-step procurement process is the Request for Proposals (RFP). POI intends to invite the Qualified Design Builders to submit Proposals and select one of the Qualified Design Builders in accordance with the criteria and procedures set forth in the RFP. Only Qualified Design Builders are eligible to submit Proposals and be awarded the Design Build contract. The anticipated schedule for the selection process is described below: Issue Request for Qualifications: July 21, 2017 Statement of Qualifications Due Date: August 4, 2017 Announcement of Qualified Design Builders: August 8, 2017 Circulate Draft of RFP to Qualified Design Builders: August 8, 2017 Issue Final RFP: September 11, 2017 Proposal Due Date: October 2, 2017 Award of Design-Build Contract: October 26, 2017 This schedule is subject to modification at the sole discretion of POI. Proposers will be notified of any change in the schedule for the RFQ phase by an addendum to the RFQ. A Technical Review Committee (TRC) will rate SOQs to determine the Qualified Design Builders and score the Proposals under the RFP process to Select the Design Builder in accordance with IC 5-30. SOQs shall be submitted on the proper forms and delivered electronically as described in the RFQ. The SOQ shall document appropriate experience with similar projects, team experience with the design-build process, organizational resources and depth, professional engineering licensing, financial strength and bonding capacity, history with contracting with or hiring minority business enterprises and womens business enterprises, litigation and disputes history, and experience in dealing with bonding authorities. All potential Design-Builders will be evaluated based on their team experience designing and constructing similar facilities to the Bulk Terminal proposed under this project, the Proposer team performance record including quality, schedule, and cost of each project, proposed team composition, including the teams past experience in working together, current capacity to manage the project; proposed key project personnel, and client references. The TRC will provide a rating of the SOQs based at a minimum on the criteria described above that complies with section IC 5-30-5-4 and 5-30-5-5. A copy of a sample scoring sheet will be provided in the RFQ. In addition, a formal questions and answer process will be conducted with the Qualified Design Builders prior to submission of proposals as part of the RFP process.","Quality Requirements (014000) , Regulatory Requirements (014100) , Laws (014116) , Subsurface Investigation (023000) , Facility Remediation (028000) , Concrete Forming and Accessories (031000) , Concrete Reinforcing (032000) , Cast-in-Place Concrete (033000) , Precast Concrete (034000) , Unit Masonry (042000) , Structural Metal Framing (051000) , Metal Decking (053000) , Cold-Formed Metal Framing (054000) , Metal Fabrications (055000) , Rough Carpentry (061000) , Finish Carpentry (062000) , Architectural Woodwork (064000) , Dampproofing and Waterproofing (071000) , Thermal Protection (072000) , Steep Slope Roofing (073000) , Roofing and Siding Panels (074000) , Membrane Roofing (075000) , Doors and Frames (081000) , Specialty Doors and Frames (083000) , Entrances, Storefronts, and Curtain Walls (084000) , Hardware (087000) , Glazing (088000) , Louvers and Vents (089000) , Plaster and Gypsum Board (092000) , Tiling (093000) , Ceilings (095000) , Flooring (096000) , Painting and Coating (099000) , Information Specialties (101000) , Interior Specialties (102000) , Storage Specialties (105000) , Exterior Specialties (107000) , Vehicle and Pedestrian Equipment (111000) , Furniture (125000) , Elevators (142000) , Water-Based Fire-Suppression Systems (211000) , Fire-Suppression Water Storage (214000) , Plumbing Piping (221000) , Plumbing Equipment (223000) , Plumbing Fixtures (224000) , Pool and Fountain Plumbing Systems (225000) , Facility Fuel Systems (231000) , HVAC Air Distribution (233000) , Central Heating Equipment (235000) , Central HVAC Equipment (237000) , Low-Voltage Electrical Distribution (262000) , Lighting (265000) , Voice Communications (273000) , Distributed Communications and Monitoring Systems (275000) , Site Clearing (311000) , Earth Moving (312000) , Excavation Support and Protection (315000) , Special Foundations and Load-Bearing Elements (316000) , Bases, Ballasts, and Paving (321000) , Site Improvements (323000) , Wetlands (327000) , Irrigation (328000) , Planting (329000) , Water Utilities (331000) , Hydrocarbon Utilities (335000) , Hydronic and Steam Energy Utilities (336000) , Communications Utilities (338000) , Bulk Material Processing Equipment (411000) , Piece Material Handling Equipment (412000) , Water Pollution Control Equipment (444000) ",Ed Hamilton,2669493.0,Ports of Indiana - Central Office,1395487.0,Owner,150 W.
