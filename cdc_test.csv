Completed plans call for the renovation of a 35,200-square-foot military facility. *Contract Award Date: February 26, 2018 Contract Award Number: 47PF0018C0029 Contract Award Dollar Amount: $310,486.46 Contractor Awarded Name: Grot, Inc. Contractor Awarded DUNS: 154514590 Contractor Awarded Address: 355 Price Road Lexington, Kentucky 40511 United States The General Services Administration (GSA) is seeking qualified Prime Contracting sources with proven experience and expertise in Fire Alarm replacement services within occupied spaces. This potential acquisition will be completed at the Lee Hamilton Federal Building, located at 121 W. Spring Street, New Albany, IN. The Lee Hamilton Federal Building is approximately 35,200 gross square feet. It is the GSAs goal to provide an efficient and safe work environment for patrons, tenants and employees. Replacement of the fire alarm and installation of an exterior stairwell shall be in accordance with all federal, state, local and industry standards and policies. The scope of work includes but is not limited to: Installation of a complete replacement of the building fire alarm system to provide new fire alarm control panels, remote fire alarm control panels, and any other control equipment necessary to operate a completely new fire alarm system. This replacement shall provide a complete, supervised, non-coded addressable/multiplex voice-type fire alarm system that is independent and separate from other building management or control systems. Modify the existing wet-pipe automatic sprinkler system to provide complete fire protection throughout the basement. Design a high-security metal enclosure with egress capability, complete with egress hardware and access-control devices at the lower level perimeter of the exterior stairway at the south side of the building adjacent to the parking lot. The drawings and specifications are schematic in nature and are intended to convey general design intent for the purposes of bidding the work. All major elements are believed to be adequately described as part of the contract documents. The Contractor is expected, as a requirement of their qualifications, to utilize their knowledge and experience to anticipate and include in the cost of the work any incidentals which may be required, but are not specifically expressed in the drawings and specifications in order to provide a complete and fully functional fire alarm system and safe exterior stairwell, compliant with all applicable codes and standards, including International Building Code (2009), NFPA 72 (2010), NFPA 13 (2010), and PBS P-100. In addition, the Contractor is expected to visit the site prior to bidding to evaluate the bid documents and inspect existing conditions. This includes, but it not limited to, a review of the extent of demolition required for the existing fire alarm system, wall, partition, and ceiling types, spaces available for conduit routing, etc as necessary. The fire alarm and exterior stairwell contract drawings are not intended to be an accurate representation of walls, partitions, and ceiling types. The Contractor must complete a thorough survey of the building prior to bidding to obtain this information. No extra payment will be authorized for failure of the Contractor to survey all construction type of walls, floors, and ceilings for the purposes of fire protection equipment demolition, installation, and repairs required as a result of such demolition and installation prior to bid. This project will require work hour restrictions. A significant amount of project work, including all testing, will occur after normal business hours. Mockup testing will be required as part of the Contract. Mockup testing and final acceptance testing must be witnessed by GSA Fire Protection Engineer. The Davis-Bacon Wage Determination will be applicable. A wage determination from the Department of Labor will specify minimum wages to be paid to employees.
